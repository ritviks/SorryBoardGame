Currently the Hover and selection functionality is incomplete. 
Currently all of the players pawns are highlight if hovered. Not just the valid ones
I started to implement a validate function. You can find it in Game Manage line 193.
The highlight of player pawns lags when a card pops up as my dialog box takes focus away from frame.
This is fixed immediately once the from is closed so its fine.
Also I have left a commented the endGame function in the drawCard Method of Game Panel 
if you want to test writing to scoreboard.
Everything else outside of selection highlighting works completely.
